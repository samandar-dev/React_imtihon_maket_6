    During the pandemic, daily smartphone usage has nearly doubled among children
    Fortunately, one of the most effective ways to spend less time on your smartphone is to have a clear list of productive, healthy, and fulfilling replacement activities.`,

    As Richard Branson said, “Don’t become a slave to technology — manage your phone, don’t let it manage you.”

    Unfortunately, most people are glued to their smartphones. Here are some worrying statistics about smartphone usage:

    46% of smartphone users spend between 5–6 hours per day on their smartphone
    The average adult spends 3 hours and 54 minutes on their mobile devices per day
    On average, we pick up our smartphones between 150–344 times per day (that’s once every 4 minutes)
    During the pandemic, daily smartphone usage has nearly doubled among children
    Fortunately, one of the most effective ways to spend less time on your smartphone is to have a clear list of productive, healthy, and fulfilling replacement activities.

    The more you practice these replacement activities, the less time you’ll waste on your smartphone.

    Learning New Skills
    Most people claim they ‘don’t have enough time’ to learn new skills or read more books. This is a lazy excuse. The problem is not lack of time, it’s lack of time management. Each day, hours are being wasted on distractions and low-quality entertainment.

    As Richard Koch, author of The 80/20 Principle, said, “It is not shortage of time that should worry us, but the tendency for the majority of time to be spent in low-quality ways.”

    What if each day, you traded 30 minutes of mindless phone scrolling for 30 minutes of learning a new skill?

    Whether learning high-value skills to make more money, new languages to emerge yourself in different cultures, or party tricks to show off to your friends, there are dozens of skills to learn.

    Where scrolling through your phone provides a temporary high — the dopamine spike is short-lived — learning a new skill will stick with you for years, if not an entire lifetime.`,

    descInfo: ' we are taking the time to review some of the most notable trends for the upcoming year. These past couple of years serve as particularly strong evidence of the constant and fast development happening in the UX/UI industry — both in terms of technologies and design trends implemented. Explorations are unfolding in all sorts of directions — some short-lived, some reimagined and some recurring with a greater focus than ever before. Below we present to you in greater detail some of the explorations that will stick throughout 2022.',
    desc: `
    The big typography trend from past years is just getting bolder and sizes are going up! Stylish hero sections with big bold typography and little to no imagery will be everything in the following year.

    Designers and users alike have become increasingly accustomed to big typography standing loud and proud, front and center on their landing pages. Be it large and grotesque sans serifs or contemporary and lux serifs — the bigger the better is what this trend is all about. With a careful selection of fonts, websites are making bolder statements than ever, to catch their audience’s attention and to communicate their messages effectively.
      
    With everything that is going on, we would go so far as to say that everyone has learned to take themselves less seriously over the past few years. This has afforded us the wiggle room for more experimentations and certainly more enjoyable outcomes — in design and beyond. That said, designers have felt compelled to move away from plain and pragmatic user experiences in favor of fun, funny, and even silly interactions. As surprising as it is, making someone smile might just be the way for your website or app to leave a strong and memorable impression.`,

    Doesn’t the world appreciate quality art/tweets/photography/film-making/writing anymore?

    Online guru guy said create GREAT content. That’s precisely what you did.

    What gives?

    Maybe you do suck after all.

    Your motivation to do more is out the window.

    It could be days…weeks until you build up the courage to create something new.

    . . .

    Crappy traction.

    Anyone who has had anything to share with the world has been there.

    Your confidence may have taken a hit, but the last thing you want to do now is to create less.

    Many people say it’s all about the quality. But that’s not strictly true, even if it is the case for a few lucky one-hitters.

    Creating QUALITY things is no longer the be-all-end-all solution to attracting an enthusiastic audience these days.

    With the range, depth and amount of talent out there, bolstered by the fact that more people have access to better tools, quality is now a given. It is expected.

    You can paint like Van Gogh (in public) today and still go unnoticed. It’s the sad truth.

    But there is a solution…

    To make an impact; to gain traction; to see engagement with what you do, now requires you to go beyond quality.

    You need a host of other things too. Understanding your audience, creating from the heart, being authentic, being unique, being up to speed on trends a little, but most notably…

    You need to show that you believe in your work.
    When you create one or two great pieces, this might attract some attention, but usually, it’s not enough.`,

    If there is one thing there’s no shortage of, it’s apps. Apps stores are bursting at the seams, making it tricky to separate the wheat from the chaff.
    
    Okta’s recent “Business at Work” report cuts through the noise. They used data from 14.000 customers to identify the ten fastest-growing apps in the world (by customers). Their results are below.
    
    Regular readers of our blog will recognize some apps like Notion or monday.com. However, others may be less familiar to non-specialists, so in this post we’ll introduce you to each of them.
    
    Read on to find out more about the ten fastest-growing apps in 2022!`,
    desc: `
    Notion
    Notion is a very popular app with a loyal following and we’ve covered it several times, but in case you’ve been living under a rock…

    Notion is a silo-busting app that allows effective collaboration between diverse teams. Notion makes it easy for anyone to craft documents, dashboards, websites, and more — all using drag and drop. In Notion, to-do lists and enterprise knowledge live side by side, helping teams keep sight of the valuable context.

    Notion users also benefit from an extended ecosystem of creators who create a large collection of community-made templates, resources, and integrations.

    Notion lets you design a home space, a developmental roadmap, document libraries, 3D wiki spaces, meeting resources, notes, and on-demand website publishing, all from a collaborative and intuitive workspace.

    TripActions
    TripActions is rethinking travel, corporate card, and expense management. The app provides smaller companies with technology that were previously available only at large, multinational enterprises.

    TripActions lets users manage management, corporate cards, travel booking, and reportable expenses. The app draws on a large inventory of bookings and local travel agents and claims some “AI” functionality.

    With TripAction, business travel, corporate cards, and expense reporting all fold into a single solution, making it easy for travellers, administrators, and upper management to quickly plan and approve travel, and to manage travel expenses with dashboards and compliance rules.

    Speaking as someone who’s spent many, many hours filling in expense reports, that all sounds pretty awesome. 😅`,

    descTitle: `**Disclaimer** Shopee has succeeded in becoming one of the favorite marketplaces for Indonesian people.`,
    descInfo: `
    Mixed languages (English and Bahasa Indonesia)
    
    This case study was first written on Google Slides in early March 2022, however, I relocated it to Medium in early May 2022. As a result, as of the months of April and May, this version of Shopee could be outdated.
    
    Background
     Shopee is ranked second as e-commerce with the highest average monthly web visits, with 127 million visitors (Sirclo, 2022).`,
    desc: `
    With its large number of active users, Shopee has evolved into a super app that allows users to do everything in one place. This implies that there are a lot of features that aren’t geared toward purchasing or selling. This gradual but steady shift has enticed new and existing customers to continue to use Shopee for everything in their everyday lives, not only for shopping and selling purposes. This change, on the other hand, comes with a slew of drawbacks.

    With the addition of the new features, the Shopee mobile application actually complicates the crucial parts of the app, such as the product search and selection process, which is ironic given that a marketplace seeks to be a platform for carrying out purchasing and selling process. There are a variety of reasons for this, including too much information on one page, no clear guarantee of authenticity, too many features, the app being too cluttered, and so on.

    The objectives of this case study
    In general, I hope to be able to refocus Shopee’s core purpose back to shopping and selling, while maintaining support for the additional features, through this case study. The following are a few of the primary objectives:

    Fix the Shopee mobile app usability issues as best as possible
    Create a simpler look
    Improve the product search and selection process
    Improve the cart feature
    The process
    1. Empathize
    In this step, I delved deeper into Shopee’s corporate goals, competitors, online shopping behavior in relation to COVID-19, and user research to discover customers’ pain points. Due to time constraints, user research was conducted via survey, app reviews, and heuristic evaluation. All of these methods were done to validate my biggest concern about the app, which is the product search and selection process and the use of the cart feature.

    Survey
    The survey received 25 responses, however by the time the data was evaluated, only 24 people had completed it.

    Main findings:

    100% of the participants have previously shopped online
    91.7% of the participants are aged between 18–25 years old
    54.2% of participants shop roughly 5 times per month on a regular basis
    83.3% of the participants chose Shopee as their favorite marketplace (followed by Tokopedia)`,

    Even if you do that, you may not receive any answer when you apply to UX writing positions.
    
    Why?
    
    Because the process of creating a resume is complex.
    
    You need to take all your experience and boil it down to one page. What if it’s two pages long? Most recruiting and hiring managers will throw it out immediately. Not even a second look.

In both scenarios, how do you become resourceful enough to ensure you get what’s needed across to the potential hiring manager? It’s not easy, but there are best practices that can help guide you.

    The process of writing a resume is similar to the process of writing UX copy. As a UX writer, you develop content that is relevant, concise, helpful, and clear to assist users in completing their objectives. In this case, the content is your resume and your user is the hiring manager. However, that’s the last step to think about. The first step is you as a UX writer need to understand the product(s) in question (e.g. the company that you want to work at), and you are required to undertake user research (who’s looking at your resume).
    
    Keep in mind that when you’re preparing your resume, the hiring manager will evaluate your abilities as a problem-solver.
    
    Many UX writers waste their time by referring to the following from a bird’s eye view:
    
    Writing blog articles
    Writing press releases
    Working on multiple projects
    Working with stakeholders
    Collaborating with team members
    Working in a high-paced environment
    This is boring because it’s either irrelevant or expected. For the last three points, these are the terms that everyone is using. If you’re like everyone, then you’re no one. Just another discarded resume.
    
    So, how do you differentiate yourself? Do you know what information hiring managers and recruiters appreciate seeing on a resume? How about these skills:
    
    Understanding of design principles
    Know-how of creating conversational chatbots
    Website creation experience
    Ability to lead UX projects
    Ability to push large UX projects over the goal line
    Managing, editing, and creating content style guides
    Designing product information architecture
    Writing copy for error messages and empty states
    Using UX design skills to create low-fidelity prototypes
    Be specific and talk about how your work has helped users.
    
    What is the Best UX Writer Resume Format?
    There are three good ways to write a resume for a UX writing role.
    
    Reverse Chronological (most recent work experience first)
    Combination (ATS compliant)
    Functional (non-ATS compliant)
    If you want to hire a UX writer, you need to make their resume compatible with ATS (Applicant Tracking Software). Did you know that 98 percent of Fortune 500 companies use ATS to find out which resumes aren’t worth reading?
    
    All resumes are scanned by an ATS, which only accepts those with the right keywords in them. There is no need for hiring managers to go through all UX writer resumes. This saves them time and effort.
    
    If you want to make your resume look good to an ATS, read the job description. Include exact words and phrases like “writing microcopy, developing content, updating style guide, or UX design.” This will pop up your resume when the hiring manager filters using an ATS.
    
    Now, go ahead and add these types of phrases to your skills and work history.
    
    An organized UX writer resume format with the right keywords is a good way to make your resume stand out.`,

    title: '3 Key Rules of Written Communication',
    itemsDesc: `Here’s a quick update on the latest chapter of my life! — I moved to Jakarta, Indonesia exactly four months ago. This is a view of a particularly dramatic sunset from my apartment window.....`,
    img: 'https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ipnAm6snbmmhZqjej3PZqg.jpeg',
    descTitle: `There is one thing I’ve noticed about business`,
    descInfo: ` communication in tech — it is becoming more and more informal, relaxed, and personal.

    Let me explain what I mean.
    
    Here is an email that I recently got from a business contact.`,
    desc: `
    At first glance, there is nothing interesting going on in this email. However, if you are observant (=if you pay close attention to things), you will note a few useful points that you can start using in your workplace communication.

    So, what can we note about this email?
    
    #1 It is informal
    Note that the author uses a contraction (“w”) instead of typing out the full word (“with”). This is totally acceptable in modern-day tech communication.
    
    When you use contractions, though, make sure they:
    
    will be understood by the recipients of your message
    actually save time and help make your message more readable
    #2 It is relaxed
    Reading this email feels like talking to a friend rather than a boss or a subordinate. That’s because most tech companies are not built as top-down hierarchies. Instead, they have more of a flat structure where everyone is equal, and the communication style reflects that.
    
    #3 It is personal and friendly
    Here’s one cool communication trick: use phrasal verbs when you want to sound friendly.
    
    Note that in this email, the author uses the phrasal verb “I will get back to you” instead of “I will contact you again”.
    
    The takeaway is that phrasal verbs always sound friendlier and less formal than the “regular” words.
    
    Let’s compare:
    
    
    That brings me to my next point.
    
    Friendly does NOT mean inappropriate.
    
    When you use a friendly tone in your written communication, it is still important to be respectful and make a positive impression. Expressing feelings of anger, frustration, resentment, etc. is a big no-no.
    
    How can you make sure you’re friendly and appropriate at the same time?
    
    Use positive-sounding language
    Avoid finger-pointing statements
    Pro tip: Change “you” statements to “I” statements. For example, instead of saying “You never told me about this event” say “I don’t remember discussing this event”.
    
    Now, imagine a situation.
    
    You’re in a zoom room waiting for someone you have scheduled a meeting with to show up. Ten minutes go by, and they’re still nowhere to be seen. What do you do?
    
    You can email them with a reminder, as I did in this message.
    Does this email give you the impression that I was angry writing it?

    No. Was I angry? Well, yeah. A bit. Who likes a no-show (=a person who is expected to be somewhere but doesn’t arrive)?

    You might have noticed that this reminder checks off all three important boxes:`,

    itemsDesc: `A mini-series about crafting your UX writing portfolio with minimal effort and maximized outcome. — With Notion, you are able to do so many things, like corporate wikis, documentation, transcript repositories or.....`,

    descTitle: `What’s in a name? And would a rose by any other name really smell as sweet?`,
    descInfo: ` Technically yes, but you’d never stop to smell it in the first place if it was called a shoehorn. Maybe names do matter.

    In this article, we’ll explore what, if any, are the differences between UX writing and content design. Many philosophize about what these terms ought to mean, but I want to uncover what they mean in practice. How are they used among those who are recruiting or hiring UX writers and content designers? What tasks, duties, and responsibilities are expected? And what experience and education are required?
    
    To answer these questions and shed some much-needed light on the matter, I analyzed UX writing and content design job postings.
    
    But we’ll be doing more than just combing through humdrum LinkedIn posts. There’s gonna be a fun quiz, I talk to the Duo Lingo owl, there’s a random title generator for writers, a downloadable “A–Z of Writers in Tech Titles” poster, and oh, so much more. So clear your schedule, cancel your Zooms, and grab a snack — it’s gonna be a fun one.`,
    desc: `
    UX writing vs. content design
    Everything starts with research. I searched the terms “UX writer” and “Content designer” on LinkedIn, and took ten examples from each to examine a few key metrics: responsibilities/duties, qualifications/experience, and required education. I look for commonalities, both within each title, and then between the two.
    
    I focused on hard rather than soft skills like “works well with others.” I also didn’t just take the first ten search results, which tend to be dominated by a few large companies with duplicate posts. Also, I looked at posts from a variety of countries to ensure that the results weren’t skewed by one country’s approach.
    
    Below are tables and summaries of twenty job posts: ten for “UX writer” and ten for “Content designer.” I paraphrased things for brevity’s sake — you’re welcome to check the posts for the original phrasing.
    
    UX Writing posts table (view on Notion.so)
    UX writing positions: summary
    
    Digging through these posts was downright delightful. Seeing how nearly every post made it clear that the UX writer would be an integral part of the product design team warmed my heart. Read through the “highlights” column, and you’ll see what I mean. The idea that the writer will just come in later to fix the copy is dead. The message is out. Writers: pull up a chair. You are part of the product design process, and everyone knows it.
    
    But there’s more good news. Many posts referenced a style guide, design system, or brand voice. Some referenced user- or human-centered language, while others mentioned balancing user and business needs. This shows how brands now understand both the value of UX and the important role that writers play.
    
    Another pleasant surprise was how often the posts mentioned some form of advocacy for UX writing best practices. So not only are UX writers part of the product design team, they’re expected to lead and share their knowledge.
    
    Other noteworthy takeaways are that many companies expect the UX writer to have basic competency with design tools and that product design decisions should be based on user research and testing, in which UX writers are expected to participate.
    
    Finally, I found that most companies don’t require a Bachelor’s degree; only two of the ten asked for it. Curious, I decided to dig a bit deeper on this point. I checked another fifty or so posts, quickly scanning for the degree requirements.
    
    Only about 20%–25% of the posts ask for a degree, with larger companies more likely to require one. And when a degree was mentioned, it was like a broken record: English, Journalism, and Communications — over and over — were the most common.
    
    The degree types didn’t surprise me. As I poured through posts, I saw an emphasis on writing: writer, storyteller, grammar-nerd, wordsmith, language lover. Copywriter, product writing, and technical writer were frequently mentioned as relevant experience. So while companies now understand that UX writers are part of the product design team, they also recognize that this is a role for a writer.`,

    1. How to write digital products with personality. It’s possible to add character to your product in many ways — with colors, fonts, illustrations, and more. Nick DiLallo highlights how choosing the right words at the right time will shape the entire user experience.

    2. Tackling complex design debt. Inconsistent product functionality, wildly differing UI components, and conflicting terminology can have significant consequences for your business — if left unchecked.

    4. How not being a native English speaker makes me a better UX writer. Companies often list “native English speaker” as a job requirement but are they missing out on first-class writing talent? We think so. This blog post by Dragana Milovanovic is an important reminder of why not being a native English speaker makes you perfect for user experience writing roles. And key to that is pure human empathy.
      
    5. Jargon and its discontents. Good ol’ jargon. We love to hate it, but sometimes we can’t write without it. Lynne Carstarphen, Senior Writer at Square, offers a glimpse into crafting clear, transparent financial copy and how to discern if and when jargon is appropriate.
      
    6. “Learn more” is not enough. Are your CTAs serving a specific purpose, or are they acting more like fillers? Alice Chen makes the case for why descriptive CTAs are more accessible, SEO-friendly, and contribute to an overall better UX. Read this post on our blog.
      
    7. How to structure and present your UX portfolio. The infamous interview portfolio presentation. If just thinking about this gives you anxiety, just know you’re not alone. It all boils down to showing that you can articulate your ideas, processes, and concepts. Need inspiration? UXfolio has your back.

This great read from Daria Vorontsova, Product Designer at Intercom, shows how you can tap into “stealing” to produce your next designs with ease.
      
    13. Design communication is a critical skill. Good designing = good communicating. Kazden Cattapan, Product Designer at Shopify, highlights how you can build trust by explaining your designs effectively and understanding the needs of your stakeholders. Great frameworks to follow, folks.

    16. The design process ≠ a process. Fact: One approach does not fit all scenarios. Instead of just thinking of design as a procedure to follow, think of it as a toolbox. Then, you’ll learn to reach for the right tools in the right situations. Jordan Bowman dropping knowledge over on UX Tools.
      
    17. How would a dog write error messages? How would a bird use punctuation? Jane Ruffino is at it again with this tabletop exercise to help develop your product’s voice, tone, and style. Check out the Miro file and get to writing.

    19. So you’re writing a writing guide. Now what? Whether you’re a new writer or just new at a company, acclimating to the brand’s voice takes time. Justin Whaley gives us a glimpse at the new source for Square’s voice and tone.
